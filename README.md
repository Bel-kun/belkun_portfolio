# FULL STORY

THERE IS A TALE ABOUT A ANGEL
WHO WAS BORED OF LIVING AMONG THE GOD

SO HE DECIDED TO DESCEND ON EARTH
TO TEST HIS FAITH AND WILL
BUT LESS THAN TO SATISFY HIS THIRST FOR ENTERTAINMENT

THE FIRST HUNDRED YEAR
HE CHOOSE TO BE A BEAUTIFULL WHITE BIRD
SO HE CAN HAVE A BETTER LOOK OF THE WORLD

BUT THE SIGHT OF WAR AND BLOOD
STAINED ITS BEAUTIFUL PLUMAGE
AND ONCE BLACKENED BY ALL THAT DRY BLOOD
HE FINALLY DIED AS A FLESH-AND-BONE-HUNGRY RAVEN

THE SECOND HUNDRED YEAR
CORRUPTED BY HIS LAST EXPERIENCES
HE DECIDED TO REINCARNATE HIMSELF INTO A SHARK OF HUGE PROPORTION
ONE OF THE LAST MEMBERS OF THIS SPECIES

THIS CENTURY WAS ONE OF THE MOST BLOODIEST
SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD

THE SKY WAS REPAINTED BLACK
BY SMOKE FROM THE FLAMES
FLAMES THAT CONSUMED SHIPS AND CITIES

THE SEA WEARED ITS REDEST DRESS
COVERED BY WHOLE COUNTRIES OF BODYS AND BURNED WOODS

REMAINING HUMAN SURVIVORS DECIDE TO STAY AWAY FROM COASTS
FOR ALMOST THOUSANDS OF YEARS
TO FLEE FROM THE BEAST THEY HAD NAMED

THE LEVIATHAN

THE SOUL OF MEN WERE MARKED BY A INDESCRIBABLE FEAR
BUT THEY WERE'NT THE ONLY ONES
HORRIFIED BY THE ARCHANGEL CARNAGE
THE GODS THEMSELVES MADE THE DECISIONS TO KILL THE MONSTER
THAT WAS ONCE ONE OF GOD'S FAVORITE ANGEL

THE BATTLE WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE GODS SIDE
AND AN COUNTLESS NUMBER OF THEM LOST THEIR LIVES

BUT THANKS TO THE LIGHT OF THE OTHER ARCHANGELS
THE LEVIATHAN HAS BEEN DEFEATED

AFTER THIS TRAGEDY
GABRIEL
CRIED ABOUT 8000 DAYS AND 8000 NIGHTS
HIS SORROW AND REGRET WAS SO INTENSE THAT HE DECIDED TO PUNISH HIMSELF

FOR HIS LAST HUNDRED YEAR ON EARTH
HE CHOOSE TO BECOME A HUMAN

WILL HE SUCCEED TO STAY IN THE LIGHT
OR WILL IT FALL INTO DARKNESS

ONLY THE FUTURE WIL TELL US !
